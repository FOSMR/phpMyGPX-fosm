2011/03/14  phpMyGPX 0.6.1d:
 - removed challis.id.au dependency.
 - some photo handling fixes: original code seems incomplete, so
   these fixes will need further work.

2011/03/13  phpMyGPX 0.6.1c:
 - missing global declarations and initialisation checks causing error
   logging addressed (Mainly $cfg, $_POST, $_SESSION & $_COOKIE)
   * Thank you Ross!
 - more user interface language strings, now for waypoint handling.
 - moved installation home default location, timezone and zoom so
   that initial map context now obvious (no more blank map if Germany
   not yet rendered!)
 - added NearMap and proxy  layers, including configurable proxy login
   details. May be turned off if not desired in installation screens.
 - Added missing logic to apply selected icon images to marker layer.
 - Update notifications now only appear if newer version is available.
 - Fixed typo in URL quoting on main page.


2011/03/11  phpMyGPX 0.6.1b:
- added AGRI layer for Australian Geographic Reference Image.

2011/03/11  phpMyGPX 0.6.1a:
- renamed all screen titles to reflect fork status of this version.
- changed "powered by" screen footers to direct to github.com.
- renamed "phone home" version check response to indicate pre-fork
  project has been updated from version 0.6.1.
- this version number renamed to 0.6.1a.
- installation now creates operational mysql database user-id if
  administrative user details are provided.
  * additional progress output for user creation and access grant.
  * grant database user access even when simply updating database
    tables (previously access granted only on full installation.)
- User interface tweaks:
  * Permit longer lists of GPX traces (100,500) to be displayed on a
    single screen, if user desires (and presumably is prepared to
    wait if system slow!)
- installation "set home location" SlippyMap now 4x4falcon.com.
- added map overlay layer for FOSM tiles at http://map.4x4falcon.com
  (new source file: openlayers/FOSM.js)
- added proxied (buffered) access to http://map.4x4falcon.com as
  default map base layer.
- English translation tweaks:
  * GPX description update button now reads "Save" instead of "Edit"
    (i.e. describe what button will DO if pressed now; rather than
    WHY activity was started... presumably user made that decision
    one screen before!)
- added selection of FOSM-related links to new column on index page.
- addressed several conditions causing apache error logging:
  * changed call to date('U) to equivalent time().
  * intialised various variables before use.
- added additional "phone home" to check if github updates present
  (need to think how to better do this!)
- added option to "about" screen to permit update to latest version
  available at github.com.
- a  number  of modules  have  been  touched  simply to  remove  stray
  embedded  carriage-returns, presumably introduced  through use  of a
  mixture  of  editors.  This  has  been  solely done  as  an  aid  to
  consistency in  this release (and  was  driving me around the bend!)
- partial fix for locale bug (we are all German!)
  * Locale   now  drawn   from  language   file  (may   need  separate
    configuration input item similar to language selection?)
