This project  is a fork of  Sebastian Klemm (osm@erlkoenigkabale.eu)'s
phpMyGPX  utility for  storing and  viewing GPX  traces  and geotagged
photographs on a web page.

Sebastian's   original   code   version   was  0.6.1   (available   at
http://phpmygpx.tuxfamily.org/), but  there is also  a patched version
available  with  added  functionality,  such as  MapQuest  tile  layer
overlays etc.

This fork  is based upon that  patched version (also  known as version
0.6.1.)

Please  see  CHANGELOG  for  detailed  overview of  changes.  This  is
essentially a "first-cut" changing Sebastian's code for FOSM use.

Version 0.6.1c adds NearMap layer  and addresses a number of error_log
issues. Waypoint icons  selected now appear both on  marker layer, and
in summary tables.

Known Issues:

* The "Phone Home" code needs  to access an external site to determine
  if a  new version of  software is available (Sebastian's  checks are
  also still  performed.) The current  choice is determined  purely by
  servers over  whom I have  control; and are  not the best  choice. A
  better solution  is required.

* A number of language strings  have been introduced which now require
  translation. (Can somebody please oblige?)
