This project  is a fork of  Sebastian Klemm (osm@erlkoenigkabale.eu)'s
phpMyGPX  utility for  storing and  viewing GPX  traces  and geotagged
photographs on a web page.

Sebastian's   original   code   version   was  0.6.1   (available   at
http://phpmygpx.tuxfamily.org/), but  there is also  a patched version
available  with  added  functionality,  such as  MapQuest  tile  layer
overlays etc.

This fork  is based upon that  patched version (also  known as version
0.6.1.)

As an aide to tracking differences,  the initial check in of this code
to github (should be!) identical to Sebastian's code.

Known Issues:

* "Phones Home" to http://phpmygpx.tuxfamily.org/check_upd.php?v=0.6.1
   whenever  "about" memu item  accessed, and  expects response  to be
   exactly the  unadorned string  "0.6.1", otherwise announces  that a
   software  update is  available.  No  attempt is  made  to check  if
   available version number is newer or older than the local copy.
